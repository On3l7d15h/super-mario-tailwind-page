# Super Mario Page

---

Hey Guys, listen up, this is my last experiment, it's a super mario page that was designed with tailwindcss, there are movement.



More important! This page it is not my, all the credits it's for [marcosrivasr](https://github.com/marcosrivasr/tailwindcss-website/commits?author=marcosrivasr "View all commits by marcosrivasr") and another thing, in this link you can search all the resource from this page. Thanks Marcosrivars! Very Good Teacher!



```typescript
//Used Technology:
interface Tecnologies {
    fronEnd: Array<string>
}

//yeah, typescript page soon!
const usedTechnologies:Technologies = {
    frontEnd: ["HTML", "TailWindCSS", "JavaScript"]
}
```
